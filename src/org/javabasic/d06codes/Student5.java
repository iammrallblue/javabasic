/*
  A Student Class:
    keyword staticï¼š
      1. can modify instance variable. which means declare a share variable in method area.
          all objects can use it.
        Format:
          objectName.variableName; (NOT RECOMMENDED)
          ClassName.variableName; (Recommended)
      2. a static instance variable is existed with Class
      3. when a object is assigned to null, object still can use static instance variable
      4. CLass is priors to object, therefore, static instance variable is existed longer
          than other non-static variables.
      5. static instance variable can assign value in a static code block
      pro:
        save memory area.

    Static code block:
      1. static instance variable can be assigned values in static code block
      2. static code block will be executed when Class is reloaded at first place.
