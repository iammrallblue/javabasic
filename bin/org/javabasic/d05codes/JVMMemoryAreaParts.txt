Java divides memory into 5 parts;

1. Stack or (JVM Stack)
    - it stores local variables of methods.
    - local variables contain parameters of methods, or variables inside of methods.
    - if local variables are out of scope{}, they all disappear from the Stack

2. Heap
    - ** All objects and Array from new keyword store inside the Heap.
    - Any things inside the Heap have memory addesses which is 16Hex.
    - Objects and Array have default values inside of the Heap. (back to check Array Notes.)


3. Method Area
    - stores all information relate to .class, includes the information of methods.
    - ** but executing methods is in the Stack, not in Method Area.

4. Native Method Stack
    - relates to the operating system (OS)

5. PC Registers
    - relates to the CPU
